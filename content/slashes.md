It’s been a new trend among the cool folks, to add different slash pages to one’s personal website. Don’t know what slash pages are? Check out [Robb’s great overview page](https://slashpages.net/). 

Here is an overview, of my slashes: 

- [`/About`](../about), if you want to learn a bit more about me. 
- [`/Blogroll`](../blogroll), if you want to check out wchoch other cool blogs I read regularly. 
- [`/Coffee`](), if you think the stuff I do is cool and want to buy me a ☕️ coffee.
