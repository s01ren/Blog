This blog is based on [Hugo](/tags/hugo) and comes with built-in tags. It even [provides a page](/tags) with a list of all tags used on this blog. Mine is not very polished, because I barely used it. 

One of the reasons is me having a hard time coming up - not to speak of sticking with - a taxonomy. If I am being honest, I just type some random tags in the front matter when I start writing a new post. Pure gut feeling. 

Question is: *should I invest time streamlining this?* 

Hm. I think the answer depends on the potential benefit of a well structured taxonomy. On this blog, itâ€™s mainly used to populate the â€žif you liked this, you may want to read â€¦â€œ section below each post. I use it to find an older post - if I remember the tag - because scrolling through the tag page with less entries is faster. Apart from that? Good question. 

Current plan is, since I am anyway working on a new theme for this blog (on my list [since March](/2024/march-2024), I will give the tags overview page a facelift and use the opportunity - assuming motivation lasts - to structure the tags, at least once. 

In a few months, I will check if I was able to follow the structure or if chaos is back. And if the latter happens - does someone has a better idea how to solve this? ðŸ¤”
