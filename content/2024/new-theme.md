I had my first blog in 2007, almost 20 years ago. Since then, I always â€žowned" a blog but didnâ€™t necessarily update it regularly. 

Over the years, URLs changed (I remember four), focus changed (travel, photo, personal), technology changed (Wordpress, Ghost, Jekyll, Hugo), â€¦ 

This blog is online since 2019. In 2020, when I had lots of free weekends, I created my first theme. Before that, I was always using themes developed by others. 

â€žMy" theme came with all monospace fonts and a minimal design. However, I imported the Bootstrap CSS (because I knew it from another project), to have something to start with. Being honest, this was way too much for my small blog. Total overkill. But no dark mode. 

I wanted a change (at least since [March](/2024/march-2024/)). So I googled, visited many of the blogs I read regularly to get some inspiration, and stumbled upon Kevâ€˜s [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org). 

I liked it. Simple design. Important stuff included, but not overloaded. 

> For example, the minified CSS for the Bootstrap framework is 144KB in total. By comparison, Simple.css is around 10KB. ([Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/))

The last rainy weekend was the opportunity I needed to create a new Hugo theme, also going through old posts, correcting broken links or fixing typos. 

I will push the new theme to production in the next days and hope that your feed readers wonâ€™t pull the whole history. But if so, I am sorry for the spam ðŸ˜…
