Last year, we all [shared our default apps](/2023/default-apps-2023/). [Robb compiled a list of all responses](https://defaults.rknight.me/). Thank you. This helped a lot. 

Today, roughly seven months later, I wanted to give an update. What apps did I exchange and why?

📨 **Mail Client: Mail.app**
This hasn’t changed. I am happy with Apples build in mail app, although it could get a facelift and a new feature or two. However, not the ones promoted by Apple on this years keynote. [^I don’t need AI writing, nor auto-sorting]

📮 **Mail Server: uberspace.de**
No update on this one. Scrolling through the other responses, I thought about trying [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) or [Migadu](https://www.migadu.com/) but was too lazy to do so until today. 

📝 **Notes: Obsidian**
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) has replaced Apple Notes. I like the markdown syntax and theming. It allows me to focus more on writing. Need to improve sticking to my journaling. 

✅ **To-Do: Reminders.app**
No update. I don’t like paying for a todo-app. This should come out of the box. And reminders is ok-ish. 

📷 **iPhone Photo Shooting: Camera.app**
No update. Looked at the camera app from Leica once, saw the price and was healed immediately. 

🟦 **Photo Management: Synology Photos**
No change, although I was thinking about upgrading the NAS under the desk to a more powerful version. 

📆 **Calendar: Calendar.App & ?**
I used Calendars 5 as my main calendar app but it will become end of support in a few days (this, not linked). I didn’t find a replacement yet. What Apple showed at the WWDC may be enough for me, but not sure. Coloring events (one calendar, multiple colors) is a must and I don’t saw that in Apple’s presentation. 

📁 **Cloud File Storage: Synology Drive**
No update, but maybe new machine. 

📖 **RSS: Reeder + iCloud**
[Reeder](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/reeder-5/id1529445840) stayed. Still the best RSS reading app from my perspective, but [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) has been replaced with iCloud. It has more hiccups, for sure, but I don’t need to maintain it. 

🙍🏻‍♂️ **Contacts: Contacts.app**
No update. 

🌐 **Browser: Arc**
Last year, Safari was my default browser. This event introduced me to [Arc](https://arc.net/). And while I needed a couple of trials - I am now convinced that Arc is my new standard, once two things are shipped: an iPad app and the Noir extension. 
[Update - 2024-06-20] Arc has a dedicated iPad version now ✅

💬 **Chat: Signal, WhatsApp**
No change. I have Telegram Threema, and Matrix - but barely use them. 

🔖 **Bookmarks: currently everywhere. Need help 🫠**
Unfortunately no update. May need to investigate more. 

📑 **Read It Later: Omnivore**
[Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) replaced [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/de/home). It comes without ads. Nothing else to add. 

🛒 **Shopping Lists: Reminders.app**
No change. Reminders works perfectly for us. No need to load another app. 

🍴 **Meal Planning: no app**
Still, no dedicated app. I tried Mela for recipes. It has a planning function. We may try it one day. 

💰 **Budgeting and Personal Finance: python + Excel**
Currently, trying to come up with a new standard. Probably a Python or R script populating an Excel or Dashboard. 

📰 **News: Sueddeutsche Zeitung**
No change but smaller subscription. 

🎵 **Music: Spotify**
To save costs, I am back on the Spotify Family Plan. I miss Apple Music. 

🎤 **Podcasts: Castro**
No change. Love [the app](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241). 

🔐 **Password Management: Enpass**
No change - but I like that Apple is building a dedicated app for this. I will try it out once released. 

Anything changed on your defaults?
