My [monthly reviews](/tags/monthly-review/) had a little break. Allowing more flexibility, I hope to overcome this. 

This is the March update.

⏱️ I am working for one and a half months since parental leave and miss spending time with the baby a lot. Thinking about working part time. 

👶 The little one started going to childcare and brought home her first drawing. Cannot tell how much I am in love. 

⛑️ I decided to get trained as a first aid instructor. The training consists of a weekend-module, three hospitations, and another full week training. That will require commitment. 

⚽️ Volunteering for the Red Cross will come with hard work this summer, as the European Football Championship is held in Germany. Five matches will be kicked in Stuttgart, increasing the need for first-aid personnel even more. 

👩‍🌾 There were days with 20 degrees Celcius in March. The new flat has a little [„garden“](/tags/garden), meaning grass needed to be cut. We also enjoyed one lunch in the sun. The tulips are blooming. It’s beautiful. 

💻 The [battle of the defaults](/2023/default-apps-2023/) introduced me to the [Arc Browser](/tags/arc/). I finally had time to test it, but am mainly back at Safari. 

🍎 Concerning my plans to [eat healthier](/2024/fat-boy-story/), I changed my fastening schedule to 16:8. According to my app, I fastened more than 2.500h in the last six months. 

👨‍🎨 I struggle with the current design of this site and think about using the Easter break for some makeover.
