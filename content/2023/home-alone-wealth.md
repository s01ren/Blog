It’s that time of the year, where I enjoy watching „[Home Alone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Alone)“. It’s one of those Christmas Movies warming my heart. 

Every time I watch it, I wonder how crazy rich the McAllisters are if they can afford traveling from Chicago to Paris over Christmas with 15 people, four of them in first class. 

Lucky me I don’t have to wonder anymore: the [NYT asked three economists to estimate the wealth of Kevin's family](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/20/movies/home-alone-mccallisters-wealth.html). 

I recommend reading the full article, because it has some neat information in it, for example that Kevin’s parents didn’t pay for the flight tickets. His uncle did. 

But if you want the quick answer: the McAllisters are the 1%. To afford the house, the travels and everything they would need a yearly income of >600k USD based on todays standards (~300k USD in the 90s when the movie was shot).
