Good news needs to be shared, too. This is a short one. 

The second part of our Christmas Travels went like a charm. We boarded the first train at 08:47, made all connecting trains without any rush and arrived at 16:45 with just 15 minutes delay in Stuttgart. Thank you SBB & DB. 🚃🚋🚂

After the [chaotic first trip](/2023/holiday-travels-part-2/), this was a blessing. 

Two more train-days planned. Fingers crossed there will also be short postings about them 🤞
