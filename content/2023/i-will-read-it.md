[Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/) wrote a helpful article for everyone thinking about starting a blog. He identified two issues soon-to-be-bloggers have:

1. not knowing what to write about, and
1. worrying that nobody will read it

For the first issue, I suggest to read either [this article by Manuel](https://manuelmoreale.com/unsolicited-blogging-advice), [this one by Meadow](https://meadow.bearblog.dev/who-am-i-writing-for/), or [this one by alienlebarge](https://alienlebarge.ch/bookmarks/2023/11/what-to-blog-about-when/). All three offer inspirations on what to write about and to not overthink it.

Concerning the second issue, Manuel offers to be [your first reader](https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it). I like the idea and want to join the party. If youâ€™re starting a blog or published something already, let me know. I will read it. Just reach out, I am only one email away.

Currently, I read more than 100 blogs regularly. Some of them post daily, others only once a month or year. They also cover a bouquet of topics. All of them are interesting and I am convinced that yours will be, too.

There are only two conditions:

1. your blog needs to be written in either German or English, and
1. your blog needs to have an RSS feed so that I will be informed about new posts in my preferred reading app.

Long story short: if you want another regular reader of your blog - send it to me.

Looking forwards to read even more great blogs soon!
