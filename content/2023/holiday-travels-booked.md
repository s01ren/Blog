Only a few more weeks until the [Christmas Holidays](/tags/christmas). As our family lives in various parts of the country, it takes some effort to organize that we can all see each other. The holidays are [travel](/tags/travel) times. 

This week, I booked the train tickets for our travels. It will be the first time, weâ€˜re doing this with a baby and I am not sure if we can carry all the luggage, but - I like train rides, especially in winter. No worries about icy roads, just looking out of the window and enjoying the winter wonderland, or reading a book. The little one also does not have to sit fastened all the time, but can crawl and play. 

Unfortunately, the German Railway Company â€ž[Deutsche Bahn](/tags/deutsche-bahn)â€œ and the train driversâ€™ union couldnâ€™t agree on a new tariff, meaning that strikes are on the horizon. As an optimist, I still hope that we donâ€™t have to switch to the car on short notice. ðŸš‚ðŸš—
