I stumbled upon this by reading [Kev’s great blog](https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023) but it seems there are a [bunch of people currently sharing their default apps](https://defaults.rknight.me/). 

For me, always looking for a new app to improve my workflow, this is great. However, I had to notice that many people - like myself - stick with the default apps of their operating system. But, I will scroll through most of the other contributions to check if there is something to try out for me.
