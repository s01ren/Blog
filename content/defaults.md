title: /defaults

This is another one of my [Slash Pages](/slashes) - created to list the apps I default to on a daily basis. 

The whole idea for this was inspired by the [Hemispheric Podcast](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) in late 2023. 

I plan to update the default apps on a regular (~ yearly) basis.

- [My default Apps in late 2023](/2023/default-apps-2023) is about my initial listing.  
- [My default Apps in mid 2024](/2024/default-apps-2024) show what hs changed roughly seven months after the initial post, including the recommendations I stumbled upon reading the other contributions.
