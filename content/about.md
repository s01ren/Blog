## 👋 Hello dear reader,

welcome to my corner of the Internet. I am Søren and this is my personal blog where I write about topics that interest me. There is no particular focus. You can read posts about hiking or cycling as well as politics, watches, or python. A colorful bouquet.

🌻 I am a millennial and vaguely remember a time before the internet was available everywhere and anytime. I socialized with the web during senior years in school, thanks to ICQ. I had my first blog in 2007.

🧑‍💻 In my day job, I am employed as Data Engineer, but reality seems to have a different opinion on this. I am project manager, business analyst, ELT developer, and firefighter. 

⛰️ When not in front of a screen, I like to spend time on the bike, hiking the outdoors, improve my running, taking photos, or reading a good old book. 

💌 If you would like to get in touch, please just reach out. It only takes [one email](/contact). And if you just want to read my latest blog posts, consider subscribing to my [RSS feed](/index.xml). 

🌐 Wondering why this blog is called `gluecko.se`? When I registered the domain I liked the idea of having something positive (glueck means luck in German) that also included the TLD (like glucose). Weird humor, I know.
